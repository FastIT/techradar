          <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

          <p>
            The DSO FastIT Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by
            an assessment result, called
            <i>ring assignment</i>. We use four rings with the following
            semantics:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>ADOPT</b> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to
              serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage
              culture in our production environment, low risk and recommended to
              be widely used.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>TRIAL</b> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with
              success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious
              usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover
              limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some
              engineers in our organization walked this path and will share
              knowledge and experiences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>ASSESS</b> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have
              clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest
              some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact.
              ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new
              and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some
              engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it,
              you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>HOLD</b> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for
              new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to
              (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new
              projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

          <p>
            The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support engineering teams at
            Zalando to pick the best technologies for new projects; it provides
            a platform to share knowledge and experience in technologies, to
            reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our
            technology landscape. Based on the
            <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar"
              >pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a
            >, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are
            interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think
            our engineering teams should pay attention to and consider using in
            their projects.
          </p>

          <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

          <p>
            The Tech Radar is maintained by the
            <i>FastIT Technologists Guild</i> &mdash; an open group of senior
            FastIT technologists committed to devote time to the Tech Radar
            purpose. The guild self organises to maintain the Tech Radar
            documents, including this public version. Assignment of technologies
            to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals, which are
            discussed and voted on in guild meetings. The Tech Radar depends on
            active participation and input from all engineering teams at
            Zalando.

          <p>
            There is also an internal version of the Tech Radar that contains
            background information about each technology &mdash; when to use it,
            pros and cons, main risks, which teams at FAST IT are using it, and
            for what purpose.
